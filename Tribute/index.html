          <h2>Early life and education</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in Karnal, Haryana. She
            completed her schooling from Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary
            School, Karnal. Growing up, Chawla went to local flying clubs and
            watched planes with her father. After earning a Bachelor of
            Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab
            Engineering College, India, Chawla moved to the United States in
            1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in Aerospace
            Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984. She
            went on to earn a second Master's in 1986 and a PhD in aerospace
            engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder.

          <h2>Career</h2><br>
          <p>
            In 1988, Chawla began working at NASA Ames Research Center, where
            she did computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research on vertical
            and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. Much of
            Chawla's research is included in technical journals and conference
            papers. In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc. as vice president
            and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of moving multiple
            body problems. Chawla held a Certified Flight Instructor rating for
            airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and
            multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. After becoming a
            naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, she applied for the NASA
            Astronaut Corps.Chawla joined the corps in March 1995 and was
            selected for her first flight in 1997.
          </p><br><br>
          <h2>First space mission</h2><br>
          <p>
            Chawla's first space mission began on 19 November 1997, as part of
            the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight
            STS-87. Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She spoke
            the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space,
            "You are just your intelligence." Chawla had traveled 10.67 million
            km, as many as 252 times around the Earth. On her first mission,
            Chawla traveled 10.4/6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the earth,
            logging more than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.
            During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan
            Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston
            Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA
            investigation exonerated  Chawla by identifying errors in
            software interfaces and the defined procedures of the flight
            crew and ground control. After the completion of STS-87 post-flight
            activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the
            astronaut office to work on the space station.

          <h2>Second space mission and death</h2><br>
          <p>
            In 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the
            crew of STS-107. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to
            scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002
            discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On 16 January
            2003, Chawla finally returned to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia
            on the ill-fated STS-107 mission. The crew performed nearly 80
            experiments studying Earth and space science, advanced technology
            development, and astronaut health and safety. During the launch of
            STS-107, Columbia's 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke
            off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the port wing of
            the orbiter. Previous shuttle launches had seen minor damage from
            foam shedding, but some engineers suspected that the damage to
            Columbia was more serious. NASA managers limited the investigation,
            reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had
            been confirmed. When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of
            Earth, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and
            destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to
            become unstable and break apart. After the disaster, Space
            Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years,
            similar to the aftermath of the Challenger disaster. Construction of
            the International Space Station (ISS) was put on hold; the station
            relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Corporation for
            resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114
            and 45 months for crew rotation. Chawla died on 1 February 2003, in
            the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, along with the other six crew
            members, when Columbia disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into
            the Earth's atmosphere, shortly before it was scheduled to conclude
            its 28th mission, STS-107. Her remains were identified along
            with those of the rest of the crew members and were cremated and
            scattered at Zion National Park in Utah in accordance with her
            wishes.
